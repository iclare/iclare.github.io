It is the prevailing\nfront end library for the web. What sets React apart from previous options is\nthat it is simply a library for intelligently updating the dom (with some fancy\nhtml style syntax if you want). React also encourages writing frontends in\nterms of components through its api and JSX. React is backed by Facebook, but\nas we’ll see it’s largely been the community that has been driving its\nmaintenance and evolution.</p>\n<p>React was initially released May 29, 2013 and was originally authored by Jordan\nWalke. In the frontend world, React can be considered a very mature project at\nthis point. While the project continually is improved with new features (Hooks,\nand concurrent mode being the standouts) React is used in production systems by\ncountless businesses. React has had a major change to its DOM diffing, however\nthe API of React has been stable through this change. This sheds some light on\nthe fact that React has matured to the point that real caution is taken against\nbreaking changes.</p>\n<p>React is an incredibly sustainable project. Not only is React supported by a\nlarge organization that pays its employees to work on the project, it is also\nsupported by a community ranging from beginners and experienced professionals.\nThe fact that you can make a living teaching React to beginners speaks volumes\nabout how sustainable it is. Dan Abramov, a co creator of Redux, was brought on\nto the React team at Facebook, which is a healthy sign that the React team is\nreceptive towards and values their community. Frontend technologies are a bit\ndriven by the idea of using the hottest new technology or library. React is\nresilient towards losing out to hot new technologies as it is simply a library.\nFor example, while Angular may have a more cohesive API, and everything ‘just\nworks’, it’s difficult for someone to come along and create something that\neither improves or slots into the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>React is MIT licensed, and is governed by Facebook employees. While Facebook\nemployees accept pull requests from the community, from the contribution graph\n<a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/graphs/contributors\">https://github.com/facebook/react/graphs/contributors</a> we can see that almost\nall of the top 50 contributors (by commits) are all or were Facebook employees.</p>\n<h1>Zig</h1>\n<p>Zig is a programming language that can be thought of as a better C. Zig is to\nRust what Python is to Haskell. The project was started by Andrew Kelley in\n2016. He currently works full time on the project. It provides a way to write\nfast programs that do not need certain safety guarantees. Basically, if you can\nwrite C, you can write Zig, and once you do, you’ll find you’re not shooting\nyourself in the foot as often. If you go from writing Rust to Zig, you’ll find\nthat you’re fighting with the compiler less often when you’re using unsafe Rust\nanyway.</p>\n<p>Zig is not exactly mature. It is hard to find companies that use Zig in\nproduction. It is also hard to find many community projects on GitHub that use\nZig. However when it comes to niche and in development programming languages,\nZig is quite popular. Zig was on the front page of Hacker News quite recently\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22679138\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22679138</a>. For the conservative systems\nprogramming ecosystem, Zig is one of the fastest growing projects on GitHub.\nFrom my own experience playing with Zig the API is very fragile at the moment,\nso I would not consider the project mature.</p>\n<p>At the moment it’s hard to say that Zig is sustainable. While the project has\nbeen around since 2016, Andrew Kelley is by far its main contributor and\nmaintainer. Zig is not backed by any company and runs solely on a small\ncommunity of contributors towards Andrew’s work. Zig sees surges in popularity\nevery few months it seems whenever it’s posted on sites like Hacker News. I\ndon’t see the project being sustained in this manner much longer however. It’s\nunlikely that the project will see a rapid surge in popularity such that it can\nbe self sustaining. Seeing as this is a systems level project it can actually\nbe quite sustainable so long as the slower growth in popularity keeps pace with\nthe systems programming ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Zig is MIT licensed, and is largely governed by Andrew K. Andrew K has the last\nword when it comes to what is contributed to the project. From my experiencing\ncontributing to Zig it is very lax when it comes to how and what you contribute\nto, though this is likely only sustainable due to how early stage the project\nis.</p>\n<h1>Comparison</h1>\n<h2>Maturity</h2>\n<p>Clearly React is the more mature project, as it sees much more use in\nproduction, and has been in development since 2011 under funding of one of the\nlargest corporations in the world. Zig has not even reached 1.0 and has a\nbrittle API. Although they were created for very different reasons and are a\npart of ecosystems that move at a different pace, I think it’s safe to say\nReact is the more mature project in this case.</p>\n<h2>Sustainabiity</h2>\n<p>Again the difference here is pretty stark. React is backed by a huge company,\ndedicated community, and has a cool factor among most younger programmers. Zig\non the other hand is largely maintained by a single significant contributor\nwhos only monetary form of support is through donations. What’s impressive\nabout Zig in this regard is that it has gained many people’s attention despite\nbeing part of the systems programming ecosystem and without the backing of a\nlarge company.</p>\n<h2>Governance</h2>\n<p>Both React and Zig are MIT licensed and have a central form of governance.\nReact’s own team decides what go in and out of the language, similar to Andrew\nKelley having the final say about Zig. React and Zig have different standards\nfor their contributors however. While Zig’s contribution guideline are\nbasically to have some tests, React has quite a comprehensive guide\n<a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\">https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Commarch","date":"March 27, 2020","description":"Commarch assignment report"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/commarch-report/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/commarch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Commarch Proposal"}},"next":null}}}
