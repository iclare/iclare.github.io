The original BSD\nlicense is also known as the “4-clause BSD license”. You should use the\n<a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ModifiedBSD\">Modified (3-clause) BSD license</a>\nin place of this license for GPL compatibility.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Modified BSD license, the\n<a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#FreeBSD\">Free (2-clause) BSD license</a>\n,omits the non-endorsement clause, as well as adding a disclaimer about views\nand opinions expressed in the software. This license is also known as the\nSimplified BSD License.</p>\n<h1>ISC</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ISC\">ISC license</a> is\nanother permissive license. This license is also known as the OpenBSD license.\nLike Modified and Free BSD, it is compatible with GPL. This license is\nequivalent to the MIT or Free BSD licenses in function, but omits some language\ndeemed unnecessary. Although brief, there are some issues with wording in this\nlicense. To avoid issues with the wording in the future, it’s recommended to\nuse another license.</p>\n<h1>MIT</h1>\n<p>There are two licenses that are typically referred to as “the MIT license”.\nThese are the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#Expat\">Expat license</a>\nand the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#X11License\">X11 license</a>.\nThe Expat license is a permissive, GPL compatible license. This license is\nsimilar to the ISC license but worded to resolve ambiguities. Unlike the Expat\nlicense, the X11 license forbids exploiting the names of copyright holders.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software Licenses","date":"February 08, 2020","description":"What's the difference?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/software-licenses/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/programming-is-forgetting-part-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Programming is Forgetting"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/free-versus-open-source-software/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Free Versus Open Source Software"}}}}}
