I also figured GitHub Pages\nwould work well enough for a simple static site.</p>\n<p>I wanted to have the option of changing the layout\nand style of the blog in case I wanted to turn it into a personal site down the road. I also wanted to\ncustomize the blog using React since I’m familiar with it. I ended up using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>\nas it allows you to write React to easily generate a static site.</p>\n<p>I was able to start writing this blog post within an hour of learning about Gatsby.\nUnfortunately this does mean I have to keep a 386mb <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules</code> folder on my system if I want\nto preview my posts before publishing them.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"January 22, 2020","description":"How and why I set up a blog."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/programming-is-forgetting/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Programming is Forgetting"}}}}}
