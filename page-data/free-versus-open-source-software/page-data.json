The promise of open\nsource is better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost,\nand an end to predatory vendor lock-in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hill argues that the Open Source’s definition for software devalues Free\nSoftware Projects. He argues that it has been shown that proprietary software\ncan exceed the quality of projects that would be considered open source or free\nsoftware. Hill also points out that many free software projects hosted online\nhave at most five contributors; again the open source initiative’s mission\nstatement gives one little reason to contribute to these kinds of projects.\nHill explains that the open source initiative’s mission statement suggests that\nmany free software projects with a small number of contributors have no\nadvantage over proprietary software. He then compares open source to free\nsoftware; that with free software advocates, these projects with few\ncontributors are still seen as a small success; that these projects begin with\nan ethical advantage over any proprietary software.</p>\n<p>Hill closes his article by stating that the open source initiative should be\nable to defend their mission statement that collaborative development resulting\nfrom free software results in higher quality software. He also acknowledges\nthat there is no need to reject the arguments presented by the open source\ninitiative that collaborative development can result in higher quality\nsoftware.</p>\n<p>I believe that main idea that Hill wants us to take away from his article is\nthat the philosophy of the free software foundation is focused on the ethical\naspects of software to argue towards contributing to free software projects,\nwhile the open source initiative argues that “open sourcing” your project will\nlead to higher quality projects, which is not always the case.</p>\n<p>I give the article 0b100 out of 0b101. I would have liked to have known Hill’s\nthoughts on combining the ideologies of open source and free software. While\nthe free software foundation focuses on ethics of free / open software, the\nopen source initiative focuses on the merits of free / open software.</p>\n<p>Some food for thought:</p>\n<p>Doesn’t a separation of idealogies cause a rift among developers, and actually\ndiscourage collaboration / openness?</p>\n<p>Can’t the open source initiative and free software foundation combine their\nefforts and idealogies?</p>\n<p>If it’s technically difficult to combine their efforts, isn’t that evidence of\nmy first question?</p>\n<p>If combining the efforts of both organizations resulted in one larger organization,\nwould that violate the ideal for decentralization?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Free Versus Open Source Software","date":"February 17, 2020","description":"Review of When Free Software Isn't Better by Benjamin Mako Hill"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/free-versus-open-source-software/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/software-licenses/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Licenses"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/webassembly/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"WebAssembly"}}}}}
