&lt;p&gt;In this second blog post I go into more detail about Allison’s talk, including some
things I agree with, disagree with, and questions I believe are important to think about
after having watched the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point Allison Parrish is trying to get across is that Levy’s Hacker Ethic,
while making sense at first, should be re-examined. That the problems with the Hacker Ethic
is not in its execution, but its underlying philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levy’s Hacker Ethic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to computers should be unlimited and total
All information should be free
Mistrust authority—promote decentralization
Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race or position
You can create art and beauty on a computer
Computers can change your life for the better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main issue with the talk is that she assumes that the source of hacker culture comes from or is heavily influenced by Levy’s Hacker Ethic. While It’s likely that the Hacker Ethic influenced hacker culture,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe that most programmers who consider them self a hacker (in the broadest sense possible) are
even aware of Levy’s Hacker Ethic in this day and age. I believe that people who consider them self a hacker in this day are simply people who are dedicated to bending computer software and hardware to their will and to their standards. Allison talks about hacker culture, but it is hard to even narrow down who belongs to the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion the Hacker Ethic is still valuable as is, so long as it is taken as a list of ideals to strive for, rather than a list of commandments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Hacker Ethic (Hacker Questions) Allison presents is certainly valuable if we are talking about
free and open source software. Though I believe it may be more fitting to call it Software Ethic Questions as
the term hacker now has such a wide range of use now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give this talk a thumbs up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some questions I think are important to think about after watching this talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How has the word Hacker changed in connotation over the years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the word Hacker gone from meaning a passion for computers and a desire to share it with all to something else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Allison go into detail about technical subjects (like jpeg compression) to illustrate simple points?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isn’t the assumption that your audience is technical going to turn people away? Wouldn’t that go against providing access and information? Is she unintentionally diluting her premise by sharing her passion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we convince people to strive to address the Hacker Questions Allison gives as a new Hacker Ethic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If one recognizes themself to have high morality and they are given the opportunity to lead an unethical software project (collecting personal information), would it be unethical to allow another individual of low morality to take the lead instead?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/programming-forgetting-new-hacker-ethic/&quot;&gt;Programming is Forgetting: Toward a New Hacker Ethic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might disagree with the conclusion, but I did enjoy watching this talk. I do agree that the literal interpretation of the hacker ethic is flawed, but I do still think that
it is valuable. Although the hacker ethic came from Levy’s book, it does not have to define what the hacker ethic is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion there are better interpretations for the hacker ethic tenants from Levy’s book, and should be considered with a context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to computers should be unlimited and total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Allison points to ‘hackers’ as having denied Margaret Hamilton from access, I’d argue that this is a bad example of the hacker ethic as the denial of access was not intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All information should be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe this should be interpreted literally. I believe we should strive to be open with information, but of course there is some information that simply cannot be shared such as personal information. It’s also important to consider that many jobs and economies rely on the fact that information can be treated as a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistrust authority. Promote decentralization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This I agree with for the most part. Decentralization should be the ideal when we can avoid compromise in another ideal such as access.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is my first post on my new blog / personal site!

&lt;p&gt;I set this blog up for a course I’m taking at RIT &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss&quot;&gt;HFOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up this blog was an interesting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to create my blog using GitHub Pages as I’m familiar with GitHub. I also figured GitHub Pages
would work well enough for a simple static site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to have the option of changing the layout
and style of the blog in case I wanted to turn it into a personal site down the road. I also wanted to
customize the blog using React since I’m familiar with it. I ended up using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;
as it allows you to write React to easily generate a static site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to start writing this blog post within an hour of learning about Gatsby.
Unfortunately this does mean I have to keep a 386mb &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder on my system if I want
to preview my posts before publishing them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
