You've probably seen some variation of these popular licenses:
  * BSD (Original, Modified, Free)
  * ISC
  * MIT (Expat, X11)

What's the difference between them?

# BSD

The [Original BSD license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#OriginalBSD),
can be used as a permissive license that is similar to the MIT license but with
additional requirements regarding advertising and name reuse. The original BSD
license is also known as the "4-clause BSD license". You should use the
[Modified (3-clause) BSD license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ModifiedBSD)
in place of this license for GPL compatibility.

Unlike the Modified BSD license, the
[Free (2-clause) BSD license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#FreeBSD)
,omits the non-endorsement clause, as well as adding a disclaimer about views
and opinions expressed in the software. This license is also known as the
Simplified BSD License.

# ISC

The [ISC license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ISC) is
another permissive license. This license is also known as the OpenBSD license.
Like Modified and Free BSD, it is compatible with GPL. This license is
equivalent to the MIT or Free BSD licenses in function, but omits some language
deemed unnecessary. Although brief, there are some issues with wording in this
license. To avoid issues with the wording in the future, it's recommended to
use another license.

# MIT

There are two licenses that are typically referred to as "the MIT license".
These are the [Expat license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#Expat)
and the [X11 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#X11License).
The Expat license is a permissive, GPL compatible license. This license is
similar to the ISC license but worded to resolve ambiguities. Unlike the Expat
license, the X11 license forbids exploiting the names of copyright holders.
