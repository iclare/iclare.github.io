This is my first post on my new blog / personal site!

I set this blog up for a course I'm taking at RIT [HFOSS](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss).

Setting up this blog was an interesting process.

I decided to create my blog using GitHub Pages as I'm familiar with GitHub. I also figured GitHub Pages
would work well enough for a simple static site.

I wanted to have the option of changing the layout
and style of the blog in case I wanted to turn it into a personal site down the road. I also wanted to
customize the blog using React since I'm familiar with it. I ended up using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
as it allows you to write React to easily generate a static site.

I was able to start writing this blog post within an hour of learning about Gatsby.
Unfortunately this does mean I have to keep a 386mb `node_modules` folder on my system if I want
to preview my posts before publishing them.
