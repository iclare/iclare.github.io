# Project

We decided to analyze React.

ReactJS is a Javascript Library for constructing user interfaces. It's very
versatile and the component-based architecture makes development more
predictable and fluid.

[React's public repository](https://github.com/facebook/react)

We felt that an analysis of React would gain us some interesting insights into
the development of a project that gained massive popularity over a short
period of time.

# Roles

# Easy Parts

well documented
lots of experts on the project history / contributors
history is well documented

# Addressing Challenges

* The size of the project is large.
  * Use git by a truck, which is a fork of git by a bus for large projects.
* There are many contributors, and multiple communication streams.
  * Communicate directly with the main experts on React.
* React has been rapidly evolving as a project and community.
  * Compare our findings with previous analysis on React
