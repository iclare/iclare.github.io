This blog post is about my thoughts on an article by Benjamin Mako Hill.
[When Free Software Isn't Better](https://mako.cc/writing/hill-when_free_software_isnt_better.html)

Benjamin Mako Hill, a board director for the Free Software Foundation, writes
that there is an issue with the philosophy of open source, at least in the open
source initiative's mission statement.

> Open source is a development method for software that harnesses the power of
> distributed peer review and transparency of process. The promise of open source
> is better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost, and an end
> to predatory vendor lock-in.

Hill argues that the Open Source's definition for software devalues Free
Software Projects. He argues that it has been shown that proprietary software
can exceed the quality of projects that would be considered open source or free
software. Hill also points out that many free software projects hosted online
have at most five contributors; again the open source initiative's mission
statement gives one little reason to contribute to these kinds of projects.
Hill explains that the open source initiative's mission statement suggests that
many free software projects with a small number of contributors have no
advantage over proprietary software. He then compares open source to free
software; that with free software advocates, these projects with few
contributors are still seen as a small success; that these projects begin with
an ethical advantage over any proprietary software.

Hill closes his article by stating that the open source initiative should be
able to defend their mission statement that collaborative development resulting
from free software results in higher quality software. He also acknowledges
that there is no need to reject the arguments presented by the open source
initiative that collaborative development can result in higher quality
software.

I believe that main idea that Hill wants us to take away from his article is
that the philosophy of the free software foundation is focused on the ethical
aspects of software to argue towards contributing to free software projects,
while the open source initiative argues that "open sourcing" your project will
lead to higher quality projects, which is not always the case.
